Input Properties
Attr	Type	Details
alt	string	Set the alt attribute which gets assigned to the inner img element.

bounds	any	Sets the bounding rectangle of the element relative to the viewport. When using VirtualScroll, each virtual item should pass its bounds to each ion-img. The passed in data object should include top and bottom properties.

cache	boolean	After an image has been successfully downloaded, it can be cached in-memory. This is useful for VirtualScroll by allowing image responses to be cached, and not rendered, until after scrolling has completed, which allows for smoother scrolling.

height	string	Image height. If this property is not set it's important that the dimensions are still set using CSS. If the dimension is just a number it will assume the px unit.

src	string	The source of the image.

width	string	Image width. If this property is not set it's important that the dimensions are still set using CSS. If the dimension is just a number it will assume the px unit.
